# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL below.


#I first grabbed all the data to view from the Spotify database.

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata;

#Next I determined who the number one artist is by popularity.

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1;

#I then determined which track by Olivia Rodrigo was most popular among the database.

SELECT track_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1;

#Last I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 

SELECT artist_name ,track_name ,avg(popularity) ,avg(danceability) ,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

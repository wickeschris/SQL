##SCENARIO: A detective needs your help with a case but you end up losing it somehow. 
You vaguely remember that the crime scene was a murder that occured sometime on Jan 15, 2018
and that it took place in SQL City.

--Find out all murder reports in sql city

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City';

-- Find out the witness who lives on the last house of Northwestern Dr

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number DESC 
LIMIT 1;

--Find out second witness

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
AND name LIKE 'Annabel%';

-- Now that we know person.id number we then figure out which transcript belongs to the witnesses
   joining tables: person and interview

SELECT p.name, i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i
ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.id = 14887
OR p.id = 16371;

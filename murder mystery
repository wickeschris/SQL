##SCENARIO: A detective needs your help with a case but you end up losing it somehow. 
You vaguely remember that the crime scene was a murder that occured sometime on Jan 15, 2018
and that it took place in SQL City.

--Find out all murder reports in sql city

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City';

-- Find out the witness who lives on the last house of Northwestern Dr

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number DESC 
LIMIT 1;

--Find out second witness

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
AND name LIKE 'Annabel%';

--Now that we know person.id number we then figure out which transcript belongs to the witnesses
   joining tables: person and interview

SELECT p.name, i.transcript
FROM person p
JOIN interview i
ON p.id = i.person_id
WHERE p.id = 14887
OR p.id = 16371;

--Morty Schapiro (witness 1) in the interview states : "I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. 
                                            He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership 
                                            number on the bag started with "48Z". 
                                            Only gold members have those bags.
                                            The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
AND

--Annabel Miller (witness 2)  states : "I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when
                           I was working out last week on January the 9th.



--From the clues the witnesses give above, you get an incling on what to do next


SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_check_in ch
JOIN get_fit_now_member mem
ON ch.membership_id = mem.id
WHERE membership_id LIKE "48Z%"
AND check_in_date = 20180109;

--The query above shows the memberid and check in dates of the people with similar values:
   Joe Germuska and Jeremy Bowers are the results.

--Finally I query (below) the plate number clue
   

SELECT *
FROM person
JOIN drivers_license
ON person.license_id = drivers_license.id
WHERE plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

-- Query Results are as of followed: 
Tushar Chandra, Maxine Whitely AND last but not least Jeremy Bowers again.

--I then run another query to see all who checked on the date January 9th, 2018 
  to see if Tushar or Maxine would result in the query.
   
SELECT mem.name, ch.check_in_date
FROM get_fit_now_check_in ch
JOIN get_fit_now_member mem
ON ch.membership_id = mem.id
WHERE check_in_date = 20180109
ORDER BY name ;

 --As the query results, the two (Tushar or Maxine) did not show up in the list 
   but however Jeremy Bowers does so we know that is his car with the license plate including "H42W".  
 
 INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
        
 SELECT value FROM solution;
   
--Resulting to Jeremy Bowers being the killer.
